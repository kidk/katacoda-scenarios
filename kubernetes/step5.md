There are many moving parts in a Kubernetes cluster. New Relic's Kubernetes cluster explorer allows you to:
* Quickly see where your pods are running
* Understand resource consumption in the cluster (with relation to your resource requests & limits)
* Focus on problematic pods & nodes
* Easily filter on namespace, deployment, etc.
* Correlate pods with application performance

### Use the Kubernetes cluster explorer

Navigate to New Relic Infrastructure and look at the Kubernetes cluster explorer
